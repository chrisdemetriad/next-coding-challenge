# Michael's NextJS Coding Challenge

## The Challenge:

Some newb has made a mess of this code. There are TODOs that need finishing off,
broken and questionable tests and the code itself is inefficient. Please fix up
whatever mess you find to get this piece of work working well.

### Extended tasks

- Our Product Manager wants a new 'checkout' page which should detail all of the
  items in the basket with their quantity and a total item quantity. Create this
  page.
- We've launched our new product API -
  <https://v0-api-endpoint-request.vercel.app/api/products> - can you please
  migrate the site to use the products from here - UK only for now. Our CTO is
  adamant that products should be available as soon as the page loads - no
  loading spinners.
- We've released a way of getting some more products. Its a bit slow so these
  can be displayed to the user after the initial products load please
  <https://v0-api-endpoint-request.vercel.app/api/more-products>
- We're launching in the states! When the user navigates to /us, prices should
  be displayed in dollars (USD) instead of GBP, and text should be localized for
  US users. Ensure the solution is scalable for future regions (e.g., Europe,
  Asia). Consider how you would handle currency formatting, locale-specific
  content, and dynamic routing.
- Run your applications tests when you push the branch to github
- Deploy your application when you push the branch to github

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, `npm install`, then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run tests with:

```bash
npm run test
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

Run the testing and linting with `npm run test` and `npm run lint`.
